##VARIOUS BUTTONS COMPONENTS

This repository, it's an example of various buttons components that you can reuse whenever you what. 

I wanted to experiment with how many different lottery options there can be for various event calls (click, add.. etc) for various parts of a landing page. 

And... it's also a way to pratice coding! ^_^ 

Here's what buttons it contains:

- Delete Button
- FabButton
- Trash Button 


#Inside the components, I used: react, css, javascript, html.
